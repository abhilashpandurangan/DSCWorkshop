# Fix this Slack card up!

1. The buttons are very blocky. Change the CSS so that they have rounded corners of 4px.
2. There seems to be a typo in the top part of the card. I don't know what a 'Memebro' is, but that's probably not the word you want.
3. The font for the buttons doesn't match the rest of the card. Find a way to make the font the same.
4. We've provided a placeholder image for you. Set the placeholder as the background for the top of the card.
5. Change the cursor to be a hand pointer instead of an arrow over the buttons.
6. Add one more button (copy of previous button) and make sure it fits in the card!
7. Have other ideas for how to change the card? Try them out!
